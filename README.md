# cproj
This is a bash script that creates a new C language project directory.
Run the script from the command line by typing ./cproj.sh followed by 
the name of your new project.  This will create a project directory
that includes a src, obj, bin, and an include sub-directory, a Makefile,
and a main file in the src directory.
